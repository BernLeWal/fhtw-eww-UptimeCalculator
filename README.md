# UptimeCalculator REST Service

The SLA calculations assume a requirement of continuous uptime (i.e. 24/7 all year long) with additional approximations as described in the source. (uptime.is was originally implemented in newLISP, which had powered uptime and downtime calculations for more than a decade. As of 2022-11-14 uptime.is is powered by Python and Flask, using the same stack as the @uptisbot Telegram bot.)
